# jbcHero
Hi and welcome to our final project, a guitar-hero-like game to improve your typing skills and accuracy,
which we have coined "jbchero"

This repo contains everything you need to play our game right away. 
It includes two versions of our application, enter and enter_v2.
enter_v2 includes our updated scoring system.

This repo also contains a makefile in case you would like to compile
yourself. in that case either run

make
