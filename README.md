# jbcHero
Hi and welcome to our final project, a guitar-hero-like game to improve your typing skills and accuracy,
which we have coined "jbchero"

This repo contains everything you need to play our game right away. 
It includes two versions of our application, enter and enter_v2.
enter_v2 includes our updated scoring system.

This repo also contains a makefile in case you would like to compile
yourself. in that case either run

'make enter'
or
'maker enter_v2'
in the directory. 

Then to run the application simply type
'enter'
or
'enter_v2'
depending on which version you'd like (both are equally as fun).

From there, you'll find an instructions page on the main menu
that tells you a bit about how to play the game itself.

note: if you are having issues getting the audio to play
correctly on a VM, go to settings > audio, and unselect and
then reselect "Enable Audio Output"
