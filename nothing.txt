When we first spent the night
Nothing else would ever feel that way
In my room it all changed
And I could see something in your eyes
I knew that nothing else would be the same
But I wish that I could grow up
The way in which you grow up
Cause then you'd never see me cry
And I'd feel like a better guy
Cause nothing nothing
Oh nothing no
I said that nothing else would ever be the same
When we first spent the night
No nothing else could ever feel that way
In my room it all changed yeah
Nothing seems to be as floral as you baby
A scarlet love and dew light touches were so sacred
I could never leave your face
Shower you with my warm embrace babe
And I still see that in your eyes
I hope that nothing will ever change
Cause I wish that I could grow up
The way in which you grow up
Cause then I'd love myself and I I'd feel like a better guy
Cause nothing no nothing
No nothing no
I said that nothing else would ever be the same
Same same same
Cause lately I've been missing you
And I just kinda want your body
I know I could ease the pain
And I know that you done missed me too
And if that's true well I'm sorry
But at least I'm on my feet again
But listen girl
Couldn't you tell I'm scared as well?
You could hold my hand
Say something something that could ease my pain
Ease my pain
